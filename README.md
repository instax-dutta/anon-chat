# AnonChat

## Secure, Anonymous Conversations

AnonChat is a web application for secure and anonymous text-based conversations. It prioritizes user privacy by offering end-to-end encryption and ensuring no logs are stored. Chats are designed to be ephemeral, self-destructing once the conversation ends.

## Features

- **End-to-end Encryption:** Messages are encrypted to ensure secure communication.
- **Anonymous Chatting:** No personal information is required to start or participate in a chat.
- **Self-Destructing Chats:** All messages are deleted when the chat session is closed.
- **No Logs Policy:** We do not store any chat logs or user data.
- **Shareable Links:** Easily invite others to your chat room by sharing a unique, generated link.
- **Zen Mode:** Option to switch to a dark, distraction-free mode for focused chatting.

## How It Works

1. **Start a Chat:** Click on "Start Anonymous Chat" on the homepage to create a new chat room.
2. **Share the Link:** A unique, shareable link will be generated. Share this link with the people you want to chat with.
3. **Chat Anonymously:** Once others join via the link, you can start chatting securely and anonymously.
4. **End Chat:** Close the chat window to end the session. All messages will be immediately deleted.

**Note:** This is a simplified, client-side application for demonstration purposes. A production-ready application would require a backend to handle message persistence during active chats and more robust security measures.
